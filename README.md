# MangaGoExtractor

*Pour Chlo√©*

## Why
This program is intended to extract from my read book list all the informations related to that book and then save them in both csv and xlsx(excel) format.

## How -Easy way ( not fully tested)

1. Click on 'Code' button and then Download the folder as zip
2. extract the folder anywhere
3. open with any text editors the file {extractFolder}/src/settings.json

```json
{
    "userName": "",//optional, if empty, will have to enter manually at launch time
    "password":"",//optional, if empty, will have to enter manually at launch time
    "userId": ""//mandatory, otherwise the program wont be able to properly navigate on the website, can be found in profile settings 'Unique id'
}
```
4. navigate to {extractFolder}/scripts
5. execute macInstall.sh (double click or run from prefered command line)
    *Note: might need to change in the macInstall.sh the PROJECTPATH, default is 'PROJECT_PATH="/mangaGoExtractor"'*
    ```sh
    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
        PROJECT_PATH="/mangaGoExtractor" # to replace if necessary
    fi
    ```
6. program should start and a browser should open.
